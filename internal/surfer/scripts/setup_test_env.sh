# This script sets up a self-contained test environment for the gcloud
# command generator. It should be run from the root of the 'librarian' repository.

# TODO(julieqiu): I'm not sure I understand why this script is needed. It seems like it is running standard Go commands. In general, I would stay away from having bash scripts and put what you need into the surfer CLI itself. See https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#language-guidelines
